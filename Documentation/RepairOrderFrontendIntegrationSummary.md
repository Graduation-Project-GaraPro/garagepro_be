# Repair Order Frontend Integration - Summary

This document summarizes all the backend changes made to support the frontend create repair order functionality.

## Overview

The changes were made to align the backend with the frontend requirements for creating repair orders. The frontend needs to:
1. Search existing customers by name, phone, email, or license plate
2. Add new customers through a popup dialog
3. Select from existing vehicles of the chosen customer
4. Add new vehicles through a popup dialog
5. Create repair orders with specific fields

## Key Changes Made

### 1. RepairOrder Entity Updates

Modified `BusinessObject.RepairOrder` to include:
- `Odometer` (int?): Odometer reading
- `OdometerNotWorking` (bool): Flag indicating if odometer is not working
- `LabelId` (int?): Optional label ID
- Kept existing `Note` field to store vehicle concerns instead of adding a separate field

### 2. DTOs Created/Updated

#### Repair Order DTOs (`Dtos.RepairOrder`)
- Added `CreateRepairOrderRequestDto` to match frontend request structure
- Properties: CustomerId, VehicleId, RepairOrderType, VehicleConcern (maps to Note), Odometer, OdometerNotWorking, LabelId, Status, Progress

#### Customer DTOs (`Dtos.Customer`)
- Added `CustomerDto` for returning customer information
- Added `CreateCustomerRequestDto` for creating new customers

#### Vehicle DTOs (`Dtos.Vehicle`)
- Updated `VehicleDto` with additional properties needed by frontend
- Added `CreateVehicleDto` for creating new vehicles
- Added `UpdateVehicleDto` for updating existing vehicles
- Added integration DTOs for vehicle history and scheduling

### 3. New Services

#### Customer Service
- Created `ICustomerService` and `CustomerService` for customer search and creation
- Extended `IUserRepository` with search methods:
  - `SearchCustomersAsync(string searchTerm)`: Search by name, phone, or email
  - `GetCustomersByVehicleLicensePlateAsync(string licensePlate)`: Search by vehicle license plate

#### Vehicle Services
- Updated existing vehicle services to support the new functionality
- Added proper DTO mappings

### 4. New Controllers

#### Customer Controller (`CustomerController`)
Endpoints:
- `GET /api/Customer/search?searchTerm={term}`: Search customers
- `POST /api/Customer`: Create a new customer
- `GET /api/Customer/{id}`: Get customer by ID

#### Vehicle Controller (`VehicleController`)
Endpoints:
- `GET /api/Vehicle/customer/{customerId}`: Get vehicles for a specific customer
- `POST /api/Vehicle`: Create a new vehicle
- `GET /api/Vehicle/{id}`: Get vehicle by ID

#### Repair Order Controller (`RepairOrderController`)
- Added new endpoint: `POST /api/RepairOrder/create-request` for creating repair orders from frontend requests

### 5. Dependency Injection

Updated `Program.cs` to register:
- `ICustomerService` and `CustomerService`

### 6. AutoMapper Configuration

Updated `MappingProfile.cs` to include proper mappings for:
- `ApplicationUser` to `CustomerDto`
- Vehicle DTOs with additional properties

## API Integration Flow

1. **Customer Management**:
   - Search existing customers: `GET /api/Customer/search?searchTerm={term}`
   - Create new customer: `POST /api/Customer`

2. **Vehicle Management**:
   - Get existing vehicles for customer: `GET /api/Vehicle/customer/{customerId}`
   - Create new vehicle: `POST /api/Vehicle`

3. **Repair Order Creation**:
   - Create repair order: `POST /api/RepairOrder/create-request`

## Validation

All new endpoints include proper validation:
- Required fields are marked with [Required] attributes
- String length constraints are applied where appropriate
- Range validation for numeric fields (e.g., Year for vehicles)

## Build Status

The project now builds successfully with only warnings (no errors).

## Next Steps

1. Test all new endpoints with sample data
2. Implement proper error handling in controllers
3. Add unit tests for new services
4. Update documentation for new API endpoints
