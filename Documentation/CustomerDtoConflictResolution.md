# Customer DTO Conflict Resolution

## Issue
I incorrectly created a new Customer DTO in the `Dtos.Customer` namespace which conflicted with the existing `RoBoardCustomerDto` that your teammate had already created in the `Dtos.RoBoard` namespace.

## Resolution
I've removed the conflicting DTO and updated all references to use the existing `RoBoardCustomerDto`.

### Files Removed
1. `Dtos\Customer\CustomerDto.cs` - Removed the conflicting DTO
2. `Services\ICustomerService.cs` - Removed the conflicting interface
3. `Services\CustomerService.cs` - Removed the conflicting service implementation
4. `Garage_pro_api\Controllers\CustomerController.cs` - Removed the conflicting controller

### Files Updated
1. `Dtos\Vehicle\VehicleIntegrationDto.cs` - Updated to use `RoBoardCustomerDto`
2. `Services\VehicleServices\VehicleService.cs` - Updated to use `RoBoardCustomerDto`
3. `Services\VehicleServices\VehicleIntegrationService.cs` - Updated to use `RoBoardCustomerDto`
4. `Dtos\RepairOrder\RepairOrderDto.cs` - Added using statement for `Dtos.RoBoard`
5. `Garage_pro_api\Mapper\MappingProfile.cs` - Removed mapping for the conflicting DTO
6. `Garage_pro_api\Program.cs` - Removed service registration for the conflicting service

### Key Changes
- All customer-related operations now use the existing `RoBoardCustomerDto` instead of creating a new one
- Simplified the customer service to only include search and retrieval functionality
- Removed unnecessary customer creation endpoints since customers should be managed through the existing user management system
- Maintained compatibility with the existing codebase

### Build Status
The project now builds successfully with no errors or warnings.
